# CovidVaccinationPortal
"Vaccine Registration Portal by DASHY" is a platform for the citizens of India to register
themselves for COVID-19 vaccination and schedule their vaccination at the nearest vaccination
centers. As India is a big country with a huge population of 1.39billion, it is not possible to go door
to door and vaccinate everyone especially in a pandemic. So we, the students of NITK have
developed a project to register the people for vaccination that will also keep the record of registered
people.
"Vaccine Registration Portal by DASHY " is a user friendly portal developed by keeping in mind
the ease of people using this portal.
The key Feature of this project: -
 Eligibility age criteria of people as directed by GOI.
 Registration process for vaccination.
 Schedule the date of vaccination.
